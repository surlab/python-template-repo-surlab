The "scripts" folder should contain code that is more "script" like, 
(typically run in entirety, end to end, and doing so accomplishes the full goal of the repo)
and less like reuseable modules and functions which should go in src
*although functions from main.py will be imported by the notebook, or other scripts like demo_main.py

This also includes a notebook for code development purposes. 
This notebook can also be useful for demonstrating and explaining the code once it is stable and the repo is public,
by utilizing the data in repo/demo_data

See the docstring of main.py for more details
