the python files in this "src" package should be importable python modules
they should contain functions or classes that might be resued by an end user
code should be broken into seperate functions especially for reuseability, but also sometimes for readability and forward comaptibility
they should be organized into seperate modules by the goal of the function/class to help with code modularity.
