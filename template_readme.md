# replace_with_env_name
Description of repository here
## Installation instructions
These instructions require:
1. a recent Python distribution, preferably anaconda 
1. an installation of git. 
1. (@devs don't forget to indicate if visual studio or other software is required)
1. The correct environment yamls. Please check the two environment files before trusting them - The dev should do make sure these work before deployment but may have gotten lazy. Packages only available through pip are not automatically included in the environment_cross_platform.yml. If there are dependancies under pip in the environment_explicit.yml file, consider copying them to the environment_cross_platform.yml or be prepared to pip install them yourself.
#### For a windows machine:
1. Open a command prompt and run the following commands
```bash
cd ..\documents\code #or similar as relevant for your machine
git clone git@github.com:surlab/replace_with_env_name.git
```
2. Double click the file "install_win.bat" to run it. This should set up the conda environment and all dependencies. 
#### OR For a windows or non -indows machine
Open a teriman and run the following commands
```bash
cd ..\documents\code #or similar as relevant for your machine
git clone git@github.com:surlab/replace_with_env_name.git
cd replace_with_env_name
conda env create -f environment_cross_platform.yml
Conda activate replace_with_env_name
