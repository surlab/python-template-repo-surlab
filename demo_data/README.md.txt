This folder should include shared data for the purposes of demonstrating the code. 
Ideally it will include all the files needed for a complete end to end run of 1 "instance"
maybe this is 1 cell or session or dataset. 
It should be able to demonstrate all of the functions in src, but not necessarily looping or parellelization included in scripts/main
Your real data should be stored elsewhere and pointed to with a path variable in repo/src/config.py
